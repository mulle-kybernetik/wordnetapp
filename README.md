# WordNet.app

This application provides a graphical interface for the WordNet lexical database of English and is very similar to the X Window System client that is part of the WordNet distribution; except it looks much nicer on Mac OS X! Note that it does not query any of the online versions of WordNet but uses a local copy of the dictionary files.
